    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Kids are disgusting. Their first couple of years on the planet are spent
      publicly soiling themselves. Then, as they learn to walk, they go on to
      discover all the horrible stuff they can put in their mouths: crayons,
      Play-Doh, worms, snails - the list is endless. As their sentience
      develops, so too does their creativity regarding the weird shit they can
      eat.
      <br />
      But what we have here is something sweet and spicy on whole another level
      - Barbecue Cookies!!!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>BBQ sauce (ketchup is also acceptable)</li>
      <li>chocolate chip cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Little side-dip squirt of BBQ sauce (ketchup is also acceptable). This
        can be a "leftover" dip from a full meal, to really get the maximum out
        of your dip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, take a handful of chocolate chip (or double chocolate chip)
        Maryland cookies and dip them individually into the BBQ sauce, like you
        would with a digestive in your tea.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
