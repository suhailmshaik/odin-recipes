        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          Kids are disgusting. Their first couple of years on the planet are
          spent publicly soiling themselves. Then, as they learn to walk, they
          go on to discover all the horrible stuff they can put in their mouths:
          crayons, Play-Doh, worms, snails - the list is endless. As their
          sentience develops, so too does their creativity regarding the weird
          shit they can eat.
          <br />
          But what we have here is something sweet and spicy on whole another
          level - Barbecue Cookies!!!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>BBQ sauce (ketchup is also acceptable)</li>
          <li>chocolate chip cookies</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Little side-dip squirt of BBQ sauce (ketchup is also acceptable).
            This can be a "leftover" dip from a full meal, to really get the
            maximum out of your dip.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, take a handful of chocolate chip (or double chocolate chip)
            Maryland cookies and dip them individually into the BBQ sauce, like
            you would with a digestive in your tea.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
