simple site created while learning web development.

this site is a joke so don't take what's in it seriouly

I used pure html for the first part of the site

I used:

anchor tags for links.

unordered and ordered tags for lists.

heading tags for headings.

image tags for images.

will add more design elements to this site using css in the near future.
